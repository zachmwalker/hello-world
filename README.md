Zach Walker's first (but not last) repository

Hello!

My name is Zach Walker. I'm a musician/composer with a passion 
for technology. My experience with sound engineering, mixing, 
and computer music lead me to pursue a career in coding. 
I hope to one day develop music-related web and mobile 
applications for working musicians.
